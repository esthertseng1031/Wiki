# Java

Java is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers **write once, run anywhere** (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.

The syntax of Java is similar to [C](/wiki/C) and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
