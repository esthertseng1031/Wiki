<h1>Go</h1>

<p>Go is syntactically similar to <a href="/wiki/C">C</a>, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.</p>

<p>The language is often referred to as <strong>Golang</strong> because of its domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go.</p>
