# JavaScript

JavaScript often abbreviated as **JS**, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm.

Alongside [HTML](/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](/wiki/CSS), JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.
